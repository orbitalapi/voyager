# Voyager

A tool for creating architecture diagrams that visualise connections between microservices and data sources in your stack.

~~We're working on open-sourcing the code for this, but we've got some work to do to modularize our main code base so please bear with us.~~

The code is open sourced in the [Orbital repo](https://github.com/orbitalapi/orbital).  In time, we'd like to split it out to it's own repo, or make the
steps for self-hosting easier.

In the meantime, any issues you find please raise them here and we'll investigate.


## Roadmap

- [ ] Import swagger / OpenAPI specs - generate all or part of you diagram by importing the schema specs of your services and the APIs / data models they expose
- [ ] Save diagrams 
- [ ] Highlight / focus on links for a selected data model or service
- [ ] Hide / show API details
